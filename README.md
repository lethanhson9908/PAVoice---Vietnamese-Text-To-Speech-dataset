# PAVoice-Vietnamese-Text-To-Speech-dataset
PAVoice - Vietnamese Text-To-Speech dataset for community.

The dataset was recorded in March 2022 by a 23-year-old amateur female vocalist from the North. The recorder reads according to the available script, consisting of 11256 sentences of different lengths and different topics collected from online newspapers. The data is recorded as '.wav' format, at 44.1 kHz, then downsampled to 16 kHz, using 1 channel, 16 bits per sample. Next, the speech audio will be automatically filtered, using Facebook Denoiser, to obtain the PAVoice dataset. In addition, the speech audio file is also passed through MFA to obtain a .TextGrid file containing the timestamp of each character.

The text is from a collection of novels and short stories from the author "Vu Trong Phung." The text is in public domain.
The audio is generated by Google Text-to-Speech offline engine on Android. The audio is NOT for commercial use.
